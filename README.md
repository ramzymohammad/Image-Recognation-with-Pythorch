IMAGE RECOGNATION

Image recognition, in the context of machine vision, is the ability of software to identify objects, places, people, writing and actions in images. Computers can use machine vision technologies in combination with a camera and artificial intelligence software to achieve image recognition.
Image recognition is used to perform a large number of machine-based visual tasks, such as labeling the content of images with meta-tags, performing image content search and guiding autonomous robots, self-driving cars and accident avoidance systems.
in this case, I will do image classification. The goal is when there is an image from the outside that looks less clear to the human eye, I can find out what class the image belongs to.

Modelling
----------
I use 2 algorithms for image recognation:
1.	Neural Network
2.	Convolution Neural Network


These are the evaluation for 2 models:
-	Neural Network : Test_score = 0.8298 
-	Convolution Neural Network : Test_score = 0.9030
___________

Based on the table above it, it can be seen that the Convolution Neural Network has highest Test_score.
